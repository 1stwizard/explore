Marketing is the practice of connecting products and services with people who can benefit from them. This involves understanding audiences, crafting compelling messages, and choosing the right channels for distribution and engagement.

While the marketing technology landscape is dominated by expensive SaaS platforms, there's growing interest in open source alternatives for email marketing, customer relationship management, analytics, attribution tracking, and marketing automation. Open source marketing tools offer transparency, customization, and cost-effectiveness that many businesses and developers seek.

With over 1,800 repositories tagged with marketing on GitHub, this community demonstrates the potential for collaborative development of marketing technologies that prioritize user control, data privacy, and accessibility over vendor lock-in.
